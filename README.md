# Markowitz Portfolio Optimization

## Welcome to the Markowitz Portfolio Project
Hello! In this project, we delve into the world of finance and investment through the lens of the Markowitz Portfolio Theory. This Python script is designed to assist in the construction and optimization of investment portfolios, balancing the trade-off between risk and return.

## Project Overview
The "Markowitz.py" script provides a practical application of Harry Markowitz's portfolio theory. It focuses on:
- Collecting user input on various assets in a portfolio.
- Calculating expected returns and the covariance matrix for these assets.
- Utilizing optimization techniques to find the efficient frontier.
- Providing insights into how to maximize returns for a given level of risk.

## How to Use This Script
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the "Markowitz.py" file to your local machine.
3. Run the script in a Python environment (like IDLE, Jupyter Notebook, or directly from the command line).
4. Follow the prompts to input your portfolio details (number of assets, expected returns, etc.).
5. The script will output the optimized portfolio allocation.

## Features
- Interactive user input for portfolio details.
- Calculation of expected portfolio return and risk.
- Optimization using the `scipy.optimize` library.
- Visual outputs can be added with libraries like Matplotlib (future feature).
